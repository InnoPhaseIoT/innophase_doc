.. rst-class:: imagefiguesclass
Figure 15: Error message reporting that VT-x is disabled

11. Hardware virtualization (VT-x / AMD-V) is required to run a 64-bit
    guest in VirtualBox and you will therefore be required to enable it
    from within the BIOS settings of your computer. The procedure for
    doing this varies from computer to computer, so detailed
    instructions are not supplied here. However, the general procedure
    involves rebooting your computer and pressing a key before Windows
    boots to access the BIOS settings menu. Once in the BIOS settings
    menu, enable hardware virtualization and boot into Windows. Open the
    VirtualBox Manager and try to start the virtual machine again.
