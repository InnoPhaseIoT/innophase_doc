Eclipse Plugin: InnoPhase IoT Software Development Tool for Application Development
===================================================================================

InnoPhase IoT Software Development Tool is an Eclipse plugin which
simplifies the application development for InnoPhase IoT product using
Eclipse IDE.

**Note**:

1. Currently, the plugin supports only one connected device. In case
more than one device is connected, the plugin might not function as
expected.

2. The plugin validates the existing partition table in the device, for the following conditions: 

.. list-table:: Partition table
   :widths: 25 25 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Partition Name
     - Sector Start
     - Sector Count
   * - Boot
     - 1
     - 63
   * - VIRT
     - 64
     - >=65
   * - SYSFS
     - 496
     - 16

   In case of an issue with the partition table, the same is indicated by a pop-up error message. The user will have to manually correct the partition table accordingly. 

3. Steps for manually developing the application are available in section: Application Development - Manual Procedure.
