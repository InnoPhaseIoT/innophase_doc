The block diagram of the INP301x Evaluation board is shown in Figure 2.
The main component on the board is the INP101x module. Key features of
the evaluation board are:

1. Standalone mode vs. Shield mode: Using the mode switch U3, either
   standalone mode or shield mode can be selected.

   a. In standalone mode, the INP101x can be accessed via micro-USB
      cable for programming and debugging. This mode is recommended for
      standalone application development.

   b. In shield mode, the INP101x module can be interfaced with any host
      CPU and can provide serial to Wi-Fi capabilities.

2. A peripheral IO header (J1) is available using which all the IO’s of
   the INP101x module can be accessed.

3. Power supply section: Based on the mode, the power for module is
   derived from either USB or shield header. A battery header is
   available which can be used as power source as well.
   a. J4 at VM_3.3V for USB power
   b. J4 at VBAT and battery connect to J10 for Battery power

4. On board sensors are available to develop sensor to cloud
   applications.

5. Switch:
   a. Set U3 switch to V33_ARD for Shield mode
   b. Set U3 switch to V_3.3V for Standalone mode
