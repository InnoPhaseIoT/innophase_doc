.. _Debugging using GDB:

Debugging an Application using GDB
##################################

This section describes the procedure for debugging the applications
using GDB to work with OpenOCD.

Prerequisites 
==============

Install Talaria TWO SDK 
------------------------

1. Download Talaria TWO SDK from the InnoPhase portal:
   https://innophaseiot.com/portal/portal-hub/

2. Unzip the SDK in an appropriate location as per requirement.

Required Software 
------------------

1. PC with Ubuntu 20.04 (or higher).
2. GNU GDB v.10.1 (or higher).

For the above Linux set-up, refer the following user guide:
UG_Environment_Setup_for_Linux.pdf.

Execute the following Linux command in any terminal window to determine
the versions of Ubuntu and GNU GDB:

For Ubuntu version:

.. code:: shell

    lsb_release -a

Console output:

|image12|

Figure 1: Ubuntu version

For GNU GDB version:

.. code:: shell

    gdb --version


**Note:** In case of Ubuntu 20.04, default version of the GDB is 9.2. Hence, GDB needs to be updated to version 10.2 by executing the following commands:

.. code:: powershell

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get -y --force-yes install gdb

Console output:

|image13|

Figure 2 GNU GDB version

Installing necessary packages
-----------------------------

In any terminal window, execute the following commands:

.. code:: powershell

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install build-essential libc6-armel-cross libc6-dev-armel-cross binutils-arm-linux-gnueabi libncurses5-dev -y

Installing ARM toolchain
------------------------

From within a directory of your choice, execute the following command in
a terminal window to download the ARM toolchain:

.. code:: shell

    sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi


Installing Python3 and dependencies 
------------------------------------

In any terminal window, execute the following commands to install
Python3 and other Python packages that will be needed. Enter the
password as prompted.

.. code:: powershell

    sudo apt install python3 -y
    sudo apt install python3-pip -y
    pip3 install pyelftools pyserial pyusb pyftdi ecdsa pycryptodome

Installing OpenOCD
------------------

In any terminal window, execute the following command to install
OpenOCD. Enter the password as prompted.

.. code:: shell

    sudo apt install openocd -y

Install gdb-multiarch in any terminal window. Execute the following
command to install gdb-multiarch:

.. code:: shell

    sudo apt-get install gdb-multiarch


VM versus Non VM based application
==================================

There are two types of application that could be generated based on the
virtual memory usage for executing the application on Talaria TWO:

1. **VM based application:**

In case of a VM based application, a portion of the flash memory is
allocated to be used as virtual memory. The application stored in
Talaria TWO’s FLASH/ROM is loaded into virtual memory for execution by
the MCU.

2. **Non-VM based application:**

In case of a Non-VM image, no virtual memory is allocated and the MCU
executes the application by directly fetching it from Talaria TWO’s
ROM/Flash.

Procedure to Debug using GDB
============================

Following is the procedure to debug the VM-based applications using GDB:

1. Open the SDK folder in Ubuntu terminal and type the following command
   to start OpenOCD:

.. code:: shell

    sudo openocd -s ./conf -f ftdi.cfg -f t2.cfg

..

   Console output:

   |image14|

Figure 3: Starting openOCD

2. In a separate terminal, flash the virtual image from the SDK
   directory.

..

   For example: Consider wifi_connect.elf.

.. code:: shell

    ./script/boot.py --reset=evk42_bl --speed=2457600 --gdb examples/using_wifi/out/wifi_connect.elf

..

   **Note**: For the GDB to work, ELF needs to be loaded. By default,
   the SDK package contains ELF files in the bin folder (which are
   stripped ELF files). Hence, user needs to build the sample
   application, generate the ELF file (by default, it gets generated in
   the out folder) and load this ELF for debugging.

   Execute make for using_wifi example application
   (freertos_sdk_x.y/examples/using_wifi) to generate the ELFs under the out
   folder.

   |image15|

Figure 4: make command output for using_wifi

   Following is the output for a sample application wifi_connect.elf.
   The total number of bytes displayed in Figure 5 will vary with the
   ELF of the application being flashed.

   |image16|

Figure 5: Flashing the application from SDK directory

   .gdbinit initialization file contains the information on Talaria
   TWO’s memory regions and the required scripts of the GDB sources.
   gdbinit file is present under the apps folder. To start the GDB
   session, gdb-multiarch should be started from this folder.

   Command line method of configuring the gdbinit file

   GDB method relies on the GDB scripts. Initially, GDB needs to be
   configured to allow auto-load.

.. code:: shell

    echo "set auto-load safe-path /" > ~/.gdbinit

..

   Manual method of configuring the gdbinit file:

   If there are any warnings as shown in Figure 6, the gdb-multiarch does not work 
   for GDB commands. Hence, create a file named gdbinit in the home directory to allow auto-load.

|image17|

Figure 6: Warning for .gdbinit file

   In the created gdbinit file add the following path:

.. code:: shell

   add-auto-load-safe-path/home/innophase/Downloads/sdk/freertos_sdk_x.y/apps/.gdbinit

..

|image18|

Figure 7: Configuring the gdbinit file

Start the GDB Session 
----------------------

In a separate terminal, run the following command from the freertos_sdk_x.y/apps
directory. In this directory, there is a .gdbinit file that configures
the GDB. Here, the RAM portion of the ELF gets loaded.

**Note**: x and y in freertos_sdk_x.y refer to the FreeRTOS SDK release version.

.. code:: shell

    gdb-multiarch ../examples/using_wifi/bin/wifi_connect.elf

Console output:

|image19|

Figure 8: Running GDB

1. Connect to OpenOCD by running ocd in the GDB prompt.

.. code:: shell

    ocd


2. Set a break point at main:

.. code:: shell

    b main

3. Run the application by executing:

.. code:: shell

    R

4. The information on the break points set can be seen by issuing:

.. code:: shell

    info b


5. A break point at a line number of a particular source file can be set
   using:

.. code:: shell

    b <filename>: <linenum>


6. If the line to be executed is a function call, GDB will step into
   that function and start executing its code one line at a time.

.. code:: shell

    s

7. If the entire function needs to be executed with one keypress, type
   next or n.

.. code:: shell

    next


8. Continue running the program (after stopping, for example at a
   breakpoint).

.. code:: shell

    continue

9. Step out is the operation that resumes execution after the function
   the program is executing terminates. The debugger will stop at the
   statement after the function call.

.. code:: shell

    finish

Connecting JTAG/SWD to Talaria TWO module
=========================================

Talaria TWO device allows programming and debugging through either of
JTAG or SWD interfaces. This section describes the hardware connections
between a debugger and Talaria TWO device.

**Note**: The Talaria TWO EVB already has the required hardware support
for JTAG.

|image20|

Figure 9: Hardware connections - JTAG

Pins 18,19,20 and 21 of Talaria TWO module are used for JTAG. However,
these pins can also be used as GPIOs for the application by disabling
the JTAG in the application.

Similar to JTAG, SWD also allows programming and debugging on Talaria
TWO but with a reduced hardware connection as shown in Figure 10.

|image21|

Figure 10: Hardware connections - SWD

Procedure to Debug using GDB
----------------------------

Following is the procedure to debug the VM-based applications using GDB:

1. Open the SDK folder in windows command line and type the following
   command to start OpenOCD:

.. code:: shell

     openocd -s .\conf -f ftdi.cfg -f t2.cfg   


Console output:

|image30|

Figure 19: Running Openocd in windows CMD

2. Use the Download Tool to flash the virtual image from the SDK
   directory.

For example: Consider wifi_connect.elf.

**Note**: For the GDB to work, ELF needs to be loaded. By default, the
SDK package contains ELF files in the bin folder (which are stripped ELF
files). Hence, the user needs to build the sample application, generate
the ELF file (by default, the ELF gets generated in the out folder) and
load this ELF for debugging.

For building in windows, follow the steps described in section:
*Building Application in Eclipse* of the document:
UG_Eclipse_Setup_Windows.pdf. 

Execute the make for using_wifi example application
(*freertos_sdk_x.y\\examples\\using_wifi*) to generate the ELFs under the out
folder.

|image31|

Figure 20: Running make command in windows CMD

.gdbinit initialization file contains the information on Talaria TWO’s
memory and the required scripts of the GDB sources. gdbinit file is
present under the *apps\\* folder. To start the GDB session,
gdb-multiarch should be started from this folder.

Manual method of configuring the gdbinit file:

If there are any warnings such as shown in Figure 21, the gdb-multiarch will not work for GDB commands. 
Hence, create a file named gdbinit in the home directory to allow auto-load.

|image32|

Figure 21: Warning for .gdbinit file

In the created gdbinit file, add the following path:

.. code:: shell

     add-auto-load-safe-path C:\Users\innop\Workspace/freertos/freertos_sdk/apps/.gdbinit 

|image33|

Figure 22: Configuring the gdbinit file


Start a GDB session
-------------------

In a separate terminal, run the following command from the
*freertos_sdk_x.y\\apps* folder. In this directory, there is a .gdbinit file that
configures the GDB. Here, the RAM portion of the ELF gets loaded.

|image34|

Figure 23: Running GDB

1. Connect to OpenOCD by running ocd in the GDB prompt.

.. code:: shell

    ocd


2. Set a break point at main:

.. code:: shell

    b main


3. Run the application by executing:

.. code:: shell

    R


4. Information on the break points set can be seen by issuing:

.. code:: shell

    info b


5. A break point at a line number of a particular source file can be set
   using:

.. code:: shell

    b <filename>: <linenum>


6. If the line to be executed is a function call, GDB will step into
   that function and start executing its code one line at a time.

.. code:: shell

    s

7. If the entire function needs to be executed with one key press, type
   next or n.

.. code:: shell

    next


8. Continue running the program (after stopping, for example at a
   breakpoint).

.. code:: shell

    continue

9. Step out is the operation that resumes execution after the function
   the program is executing terminates. The debugger will stop at the
   statement after the function call.

.. code:: shell

    finish

Example 1: Following is the output while debugging the wifi_connect.elf
using GDB:

.. code:: shell
