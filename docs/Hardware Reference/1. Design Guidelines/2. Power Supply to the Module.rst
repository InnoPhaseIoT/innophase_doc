Power Supply to the Module
##########################

For the Talaria TWO module, input voltage source V_3.3V should be
powered with a 3.3V +/- 10% tightly regulated power supply. Power supply
source should be able to supply 300mA peak current. Considering other
components on the board, a suitable DC-DC regulator should be chosen.

It is important to have decoupling capacitors placed close to the
modulesâ€™ power pins VCC and GND as depicted in Figure 1.
