Figure 19: Evaluation board connector details

The cable part number: 161340801 as shown in Figure 19 will be provided
for programming. The mating connector for the same, with part number:
532610871 is as shown in Figure 20. This connector can be used on the
factory setup application board along with the factory loader software
application to program the modules.
