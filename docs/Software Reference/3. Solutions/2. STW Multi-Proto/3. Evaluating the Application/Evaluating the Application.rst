Building the Application

Building the SMP application available in the Talaria TWO SDK will
generate the smp.elf. This needs to be flashed onto Talaria TWO to
facilitate communication with the Host controller.

To build the application, follow the procedure described in
UG_Eclipse_Setup_Windows.pdf

Programming the Application
