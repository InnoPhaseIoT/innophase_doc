The INP3201 Low Power Video Camera Reference Kit empowers embedded
designers with IoT enabled Wi-Fi camera design for multiple video
applications like video doorbell, IP camera, security camera, drones
with camera, video conferencing devices and so on.

This document describes the steps to flash the MCU firmware and run the
video streaming application. Here, the Host and Talaria TWO are
controlled by the MCU (STM32), and the sensor outputs are monitored by
the MCU.

STM32 ST-Link utility is used to flash the MCU. To install STM32 ST-Link
utility, download the software package from the following link:
https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link004.html.

MCU will control T31 (Host) and Talaria TWO. By default, Talaria TWO and
the MCU will be ON and Host will be turned ON by the MCU GPIO.

For more information on the procedure to flash Talaria TWO and the Host,
refer the Quick Start Guide (QSG) (present in the root folder of the
package).
