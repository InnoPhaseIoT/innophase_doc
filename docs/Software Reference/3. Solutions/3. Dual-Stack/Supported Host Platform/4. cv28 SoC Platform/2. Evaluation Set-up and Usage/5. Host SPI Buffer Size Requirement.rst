Host SPI Buffer Size Requirement
--------------------------------

The minimum Host SPI buffer size required is 16KB. Verify the buffer
size on the Host by issuing the following command:

.. code:: shell

    cat /sys/module/spidev/parameters/bufsiz   


If the buffer size is less than 16384, it can be increased using the
following procedure:

1. Create a spidef.conf file:

.. code:: shell

    vi /etc/modprobe.d/spidev.conf 


2. Add this to the spidef.conf file:

.. code:: shell

    options spidev bufsiz=16384


3. Reboot the Host.
