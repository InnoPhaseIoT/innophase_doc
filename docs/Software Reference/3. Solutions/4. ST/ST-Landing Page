The STM software package provides software APIs running on STM32 for
STM's NUCLEO:

1. STM32L4A6ZG or STM32L433RC-P (*I-CUBE-T2-STW-lib.zip* and
   *I-CUBE-T2-STW-src.zip*)

2. STM32U575ZI-Q (*I-CUBE-T2-U5-Alpha-lib.zip* and
   *I-CUBE-T2-U5-Alpha-src.zip*)

It provides ready-to-run firmware examples to support quick evaluation
and development of MQTT/HTTP/AWS/AZURE and HTTPS IoT Cloud applications
on STM32L4 Nucleo boards and AWS_MQTT, AWS_Sensor2Cloud and Low Power
Wi-Fi solutions on STM32U5 Nucleo development boards with InnoPhase IoT
Talaria TWO Wi-Fi add-on boards.
