**STM32U575ZIQ Host Controller**

This section provides a detailed walkthrough of the steps to set-up
Talaria TWO hosted solution demo using STM32 NUCLEO-U575ZI-Q.

STM32U575ZI is the Host controller which has the HAPI APIs running on
it. HAPI is a portable library of “c” functions which wraps HIO data
structs and resides on the Host processor. Using these HAPI APIs, users
can write applications to perform multiple functions with Talaria TWO.

**Prerequisites**

1. Talaria TWO Evaluation Board

2. Serial Cable (USB to Micro-USB)

3. Windows/Linux PC

4. Wi-Fi Access Point

5. Minicom/Tera Term VT Utility installed on PC

6. STM3 NUCLEO-U575ZI-Q board

7. EVK package

8. STM32CubeIDE
