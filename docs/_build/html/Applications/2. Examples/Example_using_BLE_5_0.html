<h1>BLE 5.0<a class="headerlink" href="#ble-5-0" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>This document introduces the reader to some of the BLE APIs available in
the SDK through a code sample consisting of a server and a client
application.</p>
<p>It covers the usage of:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Setting up advertising and connection modes</p></li>
<li><p>Creating services and its characteristic</p></li>
<li><p>Assigning UUID to them and handling their access</p></li>

<h2>BT Protocol Stack Structure, APIs &amp; Event Mechanism<a class="headerlink" href="#bt-protocol-stack-structure-apis-event-mechanism" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>SDK’s Bluetooth Protocol stack consists of two parts:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Controller Stack – manages PHY layer, baseband, link controller, link
manager, device manager, HCI and other modules used for hardware
interface and link management.</p></li>
<li><p>Host Stack – consists of L2CAP, SMP, SDP, GAP, ATT, GATT and various
profiles.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Host Stack provides the API interface to the application programmer,
through which application layer can access all the features of Bluetooth
System.</p>
<p>GAP (Generic Access Profile) defines the discovery, device management
and device connection management between BLE devices. GAP APIs provide
the way to configure advertising and connection parameters.</p>
<p>ATT (Attribute Protocol) defines attribute protocol for discovering,
reading, and writing attributes in a peer device. Attributes are where
data resides and they consist of a handle, a type, a value, and
permission.</p>
<p>GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) describes a service framework using the
ATT protocol for discovering services and for reading and writing
characteristic values and their descriptors on a peer device.</p>
<p>GATT APIs provide a way to achieve this by creating services and
characteristics, discovering them, and reading descriptors, or
requesting for a notification from GATT server.</p>
<p>Once these APIs are called, status of the devices at various states is
obtained by events pushed from the stack through the callback functions
provided. These callbacks are used for even-handling.</p>
<p>The applications functionality is defined by the way it is programmed to
react to these events. For example, by defining what happens next when
another device tries to connect and reads or writes some parameters.</p>
</section>
<section id="roles-of-server-client">
<h2>Roles of Server &amp; Client<a class="headerlink" href="#roles-of-server-client" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In BLE terminology, the server acts as a GATT server, a GAP peripheral,
and is a slave device. The client acts as a GATT client, a GAP central,
and is a master device. The terms server and client are used throughout
this document to refer to these roles.</p>
<p>The device in the central role scans, looking for advertisement, and the
device in the peripheral role makes the advertisement.</p>
<p>Once they establish connection, what the two devices talk to each other
is determined by GATT Server’s and GATT Client’s implementation.</p>

<section id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The sample code in the path examples\using_ble\src\ble_server.c
implements a server called InnoServer. It creates and starts a custom
GATT service with a single read-only characteristic. Each time the
characteristic is read by a client, the read returns a different
character string from a set of strings present on the server.</p>
<p>In addition to the custom service, the server also makes use of common
server functionality provided by the BLE API. Specifically, this adds
the Generic Access, Generic Attribute, and Device Information services
to the server.</p>

<p>The bt_gatt_create_service_128 function creates a GATT service with a
128-bit UUID.</p>
<p>bt_gatt_add_char_128 is used to add a characteristic with a 128-bit UUID
to a service. A callback function char_access_cb is provided and will be
called when the characteristic is accessed. Properties and permissions
for the characteristic are also specified; in this case, the
characteristic is read-only.</p>
<p>Finally, bt_gatt_add_service adds the service to our server.</p>

<h2>Connection/Disconnection Callbacks<a class="headerlink" href="#connection-disconnection-callbacks" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>At this point of execution, the server is advertising and ready to
receive a connection from the client. When the client connects, the
callback function connected_cb will be called. In the callback, the GATT
server needs to be linked to this GAP connection with the following
function call:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">

<p>The code sample shows how to obtain the argument required for this
function call from the argument provided to the callback by casting
hci_event with bt_hci_evt_le_conn_cmpl_t and fetching its handle.</p>
<p>Similarly, the link is removed in disconnected_cb, which is the callback
function that is called when the client disconnects:</p>

<p>While the client is connected to the server, it can read the custom

the characteristic being called. In this case, it is char_access_cb. In
the sample, this function chooses a string to send to the client as a
read response. The length argument specifies the space available in the
data array to store the read response. This is dependent on the MTU size
used for the connection. The data to send is set in the data array and
the length argument is updated to the amount of data set in the array:</p>

you just sit there.</p>

Well,neither does bathing – thats why we recommend it daily.</p>

<p>Now bt_smp_io_display_only is configured as bt_smp_io_capability_t, and
when Android Phone tries to connect to it, which has display as well as
keyboard, internally Passkey Entry method is chosen for pairing.</p>
<p>A mobile application called BLE Scanner (which is developed by Bluepixel
Technologies) is used for this example.</p>
<p>A random 6-digit passkey is generated and printed out to console for the
user to enter on Android App, which prompts for the key.</p>
<p>While making a custom characteristic in custom_server_create(),
permission GATT_PERM_AUTHENTICATION is added, so only the authenticated
client can successfully read this characteristic.</p>

<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In the secure BLE server and client section, it is shown that various
capabilities of the peer devices are exchanged, and appropriate pairing
method is selected by the BLE stack. Based on this, key generation,
exchange, and the encryption of the messages, is done. And when needed,
attribute permission can be set to use only encrypted, authenticated,
and authorized read and write.</p>
