INP3201 Low Power Video Camera Reference Kit empowers embedded designers
with IoT enabled Wi-Fi camera design for multiple video applications
like video doorbell, IP camera, security camera, drones with camera,
video conferencing devices and so on.

INP3201 Reference Kit has an Ingenic processor (Host), Talaria TWO
(Wi-Fi module) and STM32 Low Power Module (MCU). The integrated T31ZX
processor on the INP3201 Reference Kit acts as the Host processor. It is
used as an Image Processing Unit to send image data to Talaria TWO for
Wi-Fi transmission. It can be implemented as a solution with/without
MCU.

The INP3201 board can be used in the following three modes:

1. To verify the hosted Dual-Stack solution

2. Dual-Stack solution with Low Power MCU

3. Dual-Stack solution without Low Power MCU

This Quick Start Guide provides a brief introduction to setup and run
the Talaria TWO Dual-Stack Solution demo using INP3201 Reference Kit.
