Dual-Stack is a hosted solution with Talaria TWO Wi-Fi module which
helps replace the normal Wi-Fi driver concept of Linux stack. This
solution is designed to reduce power consumption without compromising
the throughput performance for Linux based application SoCs used by
ISPs, Industrial computers etc.

Dual-Stack provides the following advantages:

1. Maintains Wi-Fi connectivity during host power off/sleep state.

2. Supports low power.

3. Easy to migrate across different kernel versions.

In this solution, the Wi-Fi driver software runs in the user space with
minimal kernel modifications and makes use of the network stack on the
Wi-Fi module for housekeeping tasks (such as cloud keepalive). The
network stack on the Linux host is used to transfer high bandwidth data.

Following are the key advantages of the Dual-Stack solution:

1. Solution is a user space program and hence easy to maintain.

2. Portability across platform and kernel versions.

3. Linux kernel modifications are minimal to support SPI/TUN.

4. Existing socket applications will be able to run on the host without
   any modification.

5. It provides a shadow service of sockets so that the always connected
   feature can be achieved even when the host is in sleep.

6. FOTA and provisioning features are supported.
