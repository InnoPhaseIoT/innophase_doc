To power up the INP3201 reference kit, ensure to follow the subsequent
steps:

1. Place the jumper J7, J11, J13 PIN 2 and 3, J22. If powersave is
   enabled, place jumper J13 on PIN 1 and 2. This helps with the
   shutdown and wakeup of T31.

2. Type C USB power cable can be connected between J1 and the PC.

3. SW3 is the ON/OFF switch for the board.

4. T31 console can be connected on connector J9. Use the INP3000
   programmer board as indicated in Figure 10.

5. If PIR is enabled, place the jumper J4. If PIR is completely
   disabled, remove jumper J4.
