Eclipse Plugin: InnoPhase IoT Software Development Tool for Application Development
===================================================================================

InnoPhase IoT Software Development Tool is an Eclipse plugin which
simplifies the application development for InnoPhase IoT product using
Eclipse IDE.

**Note**:

1. Currently, the plugin supports only one connected device. In case
more than one device is connected, the plugin might not function as
expected.

2. Steps for manually developing the application are available in
section: *Application Development - Manual Procedure* .
