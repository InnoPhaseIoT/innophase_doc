Getting Started
===============

InnoPhase IoT software development kit is beneficial for development of
integrated applications on Talaria TWO with InnoOS RTOS, lwIP network
stack and GCC compiler-based SDK. It helps enable applications,
networking and wireless (BLE/Wi-Fi) functionality on Talaria TWO.

Key Features
------------

1.  Ultra-low power 2.4GHz 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi connectivity

2.  Support for WPA2 (Personal & Enterprise) and WPA3

3.  DTIM10 at 57uA enables Wi-Fi connected battery-based applications

4.  Full stack including MQTT, mbedTLS for supporting IoT
    Direct-to-Cloud for a variety of cloud services (AWS, Azure, Google
    Cloud, IBM Watson, etc.)

5.  BLE5.0 w/ Advanced Features LE Coding/FEC (Long-Range), 2M PHY,
    Extended Advertising

6.  Supports Wi-Fi Provisioning over BLE and local device management,
    plus BLE to Wi-Fi bridging

7.  Bluetooth GATT/GAP Profile support, and HCI interface option for
    host MCU-based BLE profile stacks

8.  Advanced security features including Secure Boot, PUF (Physically
    Unclonable Function) and hardware Crypto Engines

9.  Embedded 80MHz Arm Cortex-M3 w/ 512KB SRAM and 2MB Flash

10. Eleven (11) configurable GPIO plus Tx Console port (on GPIO17)

11. Dedicated ADC Input pin

12. Integrated clocks and power management â€“ only a single 3.3V supply
    needed

13. PCB antenna, U.FL antenna connector, RF Pin, and ceramic antenna
    options
