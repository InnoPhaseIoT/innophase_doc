Hibernate Mode
==============

In the Hibernate mode, EN_CHIP/RST PIN must be held LOW (less than 0.6V)
and the VDD must be ON (VDD 3V). In this mode, SRAM memory is not
retained and the RTC will be OFF. Host connected to this PIN can put the
module in Hibernate mode by a GPIO to save power. When released from the
Hibernate mode, the module will work with a default software application
stored in Flash. In this mode, the module consumes less than 1uA.
