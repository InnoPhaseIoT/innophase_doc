Module Placement Guidelines â€“ INP1010/INP1013/INP1014 
======================================================

Talaria TWO family of modules should be placed at the edge of the
application PCB for better RF performance as indicated in Figure 21.
INP1010/13/14 modules have antenna on them which makes it easy for
integrating on application PCB.

In the above case, ensure that the antenna portion is outside of the
application PCB as indicated in Figure 21.
