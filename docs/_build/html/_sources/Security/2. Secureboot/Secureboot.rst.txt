Secureboot
------------

Secureboot is a security tool which allows only validated and verified
applications to be run on the chip/board. This ensures that a board
boots using only software that is trusted by the Original Equipment
Manufacturer (OEM).

The secureboot feature provides a secure way of loading encrypted and
signed applications. This prevents loading of unauthorized applications
and performing a flash readout of application contents. In case of
secureboot mode, the configuration files are encrypted.

For more information on using the secureboot feature, refer to the
Secondary Stage Boot Loader application.
