Testing for Basic Operations 
-----------------------------

There are three application init scripts in /system/init folder:

1. app_init.sh: Basic functionality (using connection manager commands)

2. app_init_t2.sh: Talaria TWO used for power management (copy this
   script to app_init.sh)

3. app_init_mcu.sh: STM32 MCU used for power management (copy this
   script to app_init.sh)

When T31zx booting is completed, the init script loads the sdio-wlan.ko
driver module and runs the tunadapter application as an initial step to
use the Talaria TWO Dual-Stack commands.

For more details on the tunadapter, refer: UG_Dual_Stack.pdf
(*talaria_two_dual_stack_vx.y\\host\\INP3201\\doc*).
