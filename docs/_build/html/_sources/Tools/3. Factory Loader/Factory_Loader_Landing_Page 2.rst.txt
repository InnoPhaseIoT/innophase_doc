Talaria TWO modules are shipped with a default Factory Loader (FL)
program that assists in programming customer applications at a
production facility using:

1. UART/SPI only or

2. Serial Wire Debug (SWD) or

3. A combination of UART/SPI/SWD and Wi-Fi

The FL application along with companion scripts are available in
InnoPhase customer portal (https://innophaseiot.com/portal/portal-hub/).
The FL content is described in Table 1:

The entire process of factory loading is configured using a JSON config
file. On Talaria TWO, the factory loader application awaits instructions
from a HOST PC/system running the factory loader script. The factory
loader script takes a JSON config file as an input. This JSON file is
parsed by the factory loader script to automate all programming, such as
building the filesystem and programming the Talaria TWO.

Prerequisites:
--------------

1. Develop applications using the evaluation board or an application
   such as AT-commands offered by InnoPhase IoT.

2. Be familiar with Talaria TWO devicesâ€™ flash memory layout and make
   key decisions such as using secureboot.

Test the factory loading process using the EV boards prior to production
deployment.

Talaria TWO Flash Layout
------------------------

Figure 9: Flash Layout using SSBL

Boot Sector
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Boot Sector contains data such as:

1. Devices keys

2. Factory_code

3. Partition table

4. Device information

It is recommended that this section be modified only once during the
factory programming process.

Boot Image
~~~~~~~~~~

The Boot Image is the default application image that is loaded with
every boot. It is stored at fixed location in flash at 0x1000. The
factory loader is programmed by default.

Application Sector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The application sector is used to store one or more user applications.
Applications should be flashed in a stripped ELF format to conserve
space.

System Filesystem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The System Filesystem is reserved for use by the Talaria TWO firmware.

**Note**: Users **should not** modify this location.

Root/User Filesystem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The root/user filesystem is available for use by the application to
store application data. The SSBL reads certain files from this
filesystem to determine the application to run from the application
sector.

Each application in the application sector is stored as shown in Figure
10. In case of a non-VM based application, the .virt section is not
present.
